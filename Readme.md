# **Customer Churn Analysis in Power BI**

## I have used Excel and PowerBI for this Customer Churn Porject.

## **Key Features:**

## Key Insights:
ðŸ“ŒLast month, 27% of customers discontinued their service. Out of a total of 7,043 customers, 1,869 chose to leave the company.

ðŸ“ŒThe duration of a customerâ€™s contract and their time with the company are crucial in predicting churn. Customers with a monthly contract and shorter tenure are more likely to switch providers.

ðŸ“ŒCustomers who do not have a partner or dependents are at a higher risk of leaving compared to those with family ties.

ðŸ“ŒGender does not appear to play a major role in customer churn. However, senior citizens are less likely to discontinue their service compared to younger customers.

ðŸ“ŒCustomers using Fibre Optic internet tend to have a higher churn rate than those using other types of connections. Additionally, payment methods impact churn, with Electronic Check being the most frequently used method among those who left.

ðŸ“ŒCustomers who do not subscribe to services like Tech Support, Device Protection, and Online Security often experience dissatisfaction, making them more likely to seek alternatives.

## **Benefits:**
1. Reduce customer loss: Identify and help customers at risk to keep them longer.
2. Improve customer satisfaction: Understand customer needs better for better service.
3. Make data-driven decisions: Use insights to make better choices for keeping customers happy.
