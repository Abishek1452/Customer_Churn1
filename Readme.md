## Key Insights:
📌Last month, 27% of customers discontinued their service. Out of a total of 7,043 customers, 1,869 chose to leave the company.

📌The duration of a customer’s contract and their time with the company are crucial in predicting churn. Customers with a monthly contract and shorter tenure are more likely to switch providers.

📌Customers who do not have a partner or dependents are at a higher risk of leaving compared to those with family ties.

📌Gender does not appear to play a major role in customer churn. However, senior citizens are less likely to discontinue their service compared to younger customers.

📌Customers using Fibre Optic internet tend to have a higher churn rate than those using other types of connections. Additionally, payment methods impact churn, with Electronic Check being the most frequently used method among those who left.

📌Customers who do not subscribe to services like Tech Support, Device Protection, and Online Security often experience dissatisfaction, making them more likely to seek alternatives.

## **Benefits:**
1. Reduce customer loss: Identify and help customers at risk to keep them longer.
2. Improve customer satisfaction: Understand customer needs better for better service.
3. Make data-driven decisions: Use insights to make better choices for keeping customers happy.
